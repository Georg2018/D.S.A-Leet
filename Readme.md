# Data Structure and Algorithms Based on LeetCode
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/michaelliao/openweixin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/michaelliao/openweixin)

Practices for data structure and algorithms (DSA), refering to the questions in [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/).

All the solutions are located in the src dir. It only supports C++/C++11 now. The solution for every question has run pass the tests online and explains the detailed methods with its complexity.

### The DSA contains the following aspects:
1. Basic operations for basic data structures.
    * array, single linked list
    * stack, queue
    * priority queue
    * skip list
    * hash 
2. Operations for tree.
    * Binary search tree (BST).
    * Heap
    * Advanced BST
        * RB tree
        * AVL tree
        * Splay tree
        * B-/B+/B* tree
3. Operations for Graph.
4. Dynamic programing.
5. Other algorithms.
