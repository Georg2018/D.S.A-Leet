# Data Structure and Algorithms Based on LeetCode
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/michaelliao/openweixin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/michaelliao/openweixin)
Practices for data structure and algorithms (DSA), refering to the questions in [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/).

All the solutions are located in the src dir. It only supports C++/C++11 now. The solution for every question has run pass the tests online and explains the detailed methods with its complexity.

### The DSA contains the following aspects:
1. Basic operations for basic data structures.
    * array, single linked list
    * stack, queue
    * priority queue/heap, binary search tree
    * hash
2. Operations for tree, especially binary search tree (BST).
    * Basic operation of tree.
    * Pre Order, In Order and Post Order Traversal for BST.
